<PRE>Hi  Rishikesh,

you obviously used the wrong mailing-list.

&gt;<i> But, the SUBSCRIBE request with registration event was not getting routed.
</I>&gt;<i> changing CNF&lt;=&gt; DNF did not help either. I was successful in routing
</I>&gt;<i> REGISTER and INVITE requests to the AS with appropriate trigger point
</I>&gt;<i> configuration.
</I>
This is because the SUBSCRIBE with registration event is consumed by S-CSCF
and not routed further. All other SUBSCRIBE requests can be triggered on. 
Trigger points are only checked for requests routed through the S-CSCF and
for REGISTER requests (which is the only exception to allow 3rd an AS to be
informed about a registration). 

Why do you need this trigger?
Are you monitoring the P-CSCF with your AS?

regards
Franz

PS: Some further remark: There are some retransmissions of SUBSCRIBE sent by
the I-CSCF. Do you have any explanation on this?
